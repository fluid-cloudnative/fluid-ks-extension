## Introduction

Fluid is an open-source, Kubernetes-native distributed dataset orchestrator and accelerator, designed for data-intensive applications such as big data and artificial intelligence. It is hosted as a sandbox project by the Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF). Fluid enables the transformation of distributed caching systems (such as Alluxio and JuiceFS) into observable cache services with self-management, elastic scaling, and self-healing capabilities by supporting dataset operations. Additionally, by providing data cache location information, Fluid offers data affinity scheduling for applications using datasets.

The Fluid plugin is a KubeSphere extension based on Fluid, providing a visual interface for dataset management, data loading, runtime management, and more. It aims to offer a better user experience for managing Fluid core resources, lowering the barrier of CLI operations, and improving the management efficiency of data-intensive applications.

### Main Features

- **Dataset Management**: Supports creation, viewing, editing, and deletion of datasets.
